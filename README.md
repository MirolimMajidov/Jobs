# Jobs
Jobs is a open source work marketplace application, powered by micro-services ‚ò∏Ô∏è architecture and cross-platform development üì±üñ•üê≥ based on .NET 5.

## Architecture overview

The architecture proposes a microservice oriented architecture implementation with multiple autonomous microservices (each one owning its own data/db) and has one shared project to work with Repocitory and Controller for CRUD operations, but implementing different approaches within each microservice using REST/HTTP as the communication protocol between the client apps, and supports asynchronous communication for data updates propagation across multiple services based on gRPC/HTTP2.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have installed and configured [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) in your machine. After that, you can run the below commands from the the main Jobs directory and get started with the `Jobs` immediately.

```powershell
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

You should be able to browse different components of the application by using the below URLs :

```
API Gateway: http://localhost:7000/
Identity service: http://localhost:7001/, gRPC: http://localhost:7101/
Jobs service: http://localhost:7002/
Payment service: http://localhost:7003/
