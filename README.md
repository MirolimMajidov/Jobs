Jobs is an open-source job marketplace application, powered by micro-services ‚ò∏Ô∏è architecture and cross-platform development üì±üñ•üê≥ based on .NET 5.

## Architecture overview

The architecture proposes a microservice oriented architecture implementation with multiple autonomous microservices (each one owning its own data/db) and has one shared project to work with Repository and Controller for CRUD operations, but implementing different approaches within each microservice using REST/HTTP as the communication protocol between the client apps, and supports asynchronous communication for data updates propagation across multiple services based on gRPC/HTTP2. All microservices are based on SOLID design principles and used popular modern technologies. Also, configured CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for building and testing the code and publishing docker image file to the Docker Hub.

Each microservice has its own docker image file with the latest code of master branch on my [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/mirolimmajidov/) with :latest tag.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have installed and configured [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) in your machine. After that, you can run the below commands from the the main Jobs directory and get started with the `Jobs` immediately.

```powershell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d
```

You should be able to browse different components of the application by using the below URLs :
