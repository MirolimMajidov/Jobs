# Jobs
Jobs is a open source work marketplace application, powered by micro-services ‚ò∏Ô∏è architecture and cross-platform development üì±üñ•üê≥ based on .NET 5.

## Architecture overview

The architecture proposes a microservice oriented architecture implementation with multiple autonomous microservices (each one owning its own data/db) and has one shared project to work with Repocitory and Controller for CRUD operations, but implementing different approaches within each microservice using REST/HTTP as the communication protocol between the client apps, and supports asynchronous communication for data updates propagation across multiple services based on gRPC/HTTP2.
